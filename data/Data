## 🛠️ Data Processing Notes
- **Missing Values:** The `Base MSRP` and `Electric Range` columns contained zeros or nulls for older models; these were handled via mean/median imputation in the analysis script.
- **Duplicates:** Exact duplicates (identical rows) were removed to prevent bias in registration volume analysis.
- **Feature Engineering:** The `CAFV Eligibility` column was converted into a binary label (1 for Eligible, 0 for Not Eligible) for the Machine Learning model.

# ⚡ Electric Vehicle Population Analysis & Classification
**HexSoftware Data Science Internship | Project 1**

---

## 📖 Project Overview
This project provides a data-driven deep dive into the **Electric Vehicle (EV) landscape**. Using a dataset of over 150,000 registrations from the Washington State Department of Licensing, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify market trends and developed a **Logistic Regression Machine Learning model** to predict vehicle eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) incentives.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
* **Trend Analysis:** Identify the year-over-year growth of EV registrations and manufacturer market dominance.
* **Data Engineering:** Clean and preprocess features including `Model Year`, `Electric Range`, and `Base MSRP`.
* **Classification Modeling:** Build a predictive model to determine CAFV eligibility.
* **Model Validation:** Evaluate performance using Accuracy scores, Confusion Matrices, and ROC-AUC curves.

## 📊 Key Insights & Results
| Metric | Finding |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Market Leader** | **Tesla** accounts for the highest volume of registered EVs. |
| **Growth Spike** | Exponential increase in adoption observed starting in 2018. |
| **Model Performance** | Achieved high classification accuracy (>95%) using Logistic Regression. |
| **Top Predictor** | **Electric Range** is the most significant factor in determining incentive eligibility. |
